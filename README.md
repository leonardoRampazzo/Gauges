# Gauges



It's a simple way of insert gauges in your web site or any kind of this composed by html, css and js

To start you will need a div in a html file, like this 

```html
<div id="container" style="width:400px; height:400px"> </div> 

```

Once you have this nice div, that could be whatever size you want or flex or scalable
You will need to define our component with js

```javascript
var gauge1 = new Gauge('container', {});
```
